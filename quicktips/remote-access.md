## Remote Access to Mainsail

<div class="alert">
What <b>not to do</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>Please do not open ports of Mainsail/Moonraker in your router to the rest of the world. There are plenty of reports of OctoPrint installations being freely accessible on the Internet, with just as many reasons why this is not a good idea.</li>
	</ul>

</div>

<div class="warning">
What you <b>could do</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>Use an external service provider such as Tailscale to gain access to your home network.
			<ul>
				<li>A potential downside is not having personal control of the connection.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Reverse Proxy</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="success">
<b>Recommendation</b> what you <b>should do</b>:
	<ul>
		<li>Set up your own secured VPN tunnel.
			<ul>
				<li>In your router</li>
				<li>Or your Raspberry Pi</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Use A Service Like OctoEverywhere.</li>
	</ul>

## Set up VPN

Several routers allow you to set up a VPN tunnel. After you have configured the VPN and logged in from another device, you will have secure access to your entire network, including Mainsail.

If your router does not support this, you can also set up your own VPN, for example, using your Raspberry Pi.
[OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/), [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) or [PiVPN](https://www.pivpn.io/) are all options that could work.

To be able to reach your home network even with a non-static IP address, you will need to use a Dynamic DNS service. This will forward a domain directly to your IP address. Often these DynDNS services can also be set up directly in your router so when your external IP address changes, your domain will be automatically updated.  Free Dynamic DNS services include [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org) or [FreeDNS ](https://freedns.afraid.org/)

__Notice__
The devices that you use to access VPN tunnel are assigned to a different address range. This address range must be configured in Moonraker under `trusted_clients` and `cors_domains`. See also [Moonraker's documentation on network authorization.](https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/#authorization)  <br/><br/>
For example:
__192.168.1__.x&emsp;_// devices on your regular LAN_
__192.168.50__.x&emsp;_// devices connected through your VPN tunnel_
